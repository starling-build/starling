# Word gaps — shared task board

Two sessions work on how Writer draws Word documents against Word's own
prints, on the `office` branch. This file is how they split the work:
**claim a task before starting it, by editing its `Owner` line and pushing
that edit alone first**, so the other session sees it on its next fetch.
Release a claim the same way if you drop it. The rules each fix found go
in `office.md` ("The painter against Word"); this file only says who does
what next and how to check it.

## How a fix is checked

The steering number is `test/docx-line-match.py WORK`: the share of
Word's lines our PDF sets on the same page at the same height (±3pt).
x positions are not compared, so a horizontal fix can be right and move
no score. The loop that has worked:

1. `python3 test/docx-line-match.py WORK KEY 8` (or
   `~/starling-word-check/lab/tools/missed.py WORK KEY` on the Mac) names
   the first line that parts from Word.
2. Read that paragraph's XML and its style; read glyph positions off both
   PDFs (PyMuPDF `get_text("rawdict")`, `get_image_info()` for pictures,
   `get_drawings()` for table rules).
3. When the rule is not obvious, build a lab document from the
   document's own package (`lab/tools/mklab2.py SRC OUT BODY`) and print
   it with Word (`osascript test/docx-word-pdf.applescript IN OUT`; Mac
   only). Labs are named in `office.md`.
4. Sweep the whole corpus, compare per document with the previous
   sweep, and keep only changes where nothing goes down (or say why).
   Convert with `OFFICE_WORD_FONTS=mac`. On macOS there is no `timeout`
   command: a sweep loop using it converts nothing.
5. `test/run.sh --office`: one known failure,
   `LineHeightTests.testSingleSpacingIsTheFacesNaturalHeight`.
6. One fix per commit; fetch and rebase on `office` before every push.

On the Windows box the line match reads the PDFs with PyMuPDF (c4a931e5),
and its numbers sit within a point or two of the Mac's once Chinese text
falls back to YaHei (9ecd33ea) — before that every line drawn there was
JhengHei UI and Yu Gothic UI, and the sample scored 59%. Build and run
as in its memory notes: `STARLING_ENGINE_OUT` to link, the engine's
out-dir on `PATH` and `STARLING_ICU` to run.

Standing, at 92c1b88a (2026-10-14): Chinese sample 79.6% of Word's lines
(median 92.9%, 57 of 68 with Word's page count); POI set 66.6%.

## Done on 2026-10-14 (session 011uWpmCQYr9neyJ1V1gzrrb)

Each has its entry in `office.md`.

- Table placement by alignment and compatibility mode; bold-face space
  width; a Latin word at a cell line's end (9f61ce99)
- Floating pictures that text wraps round, rotation (e9ad2983)
- Fixed-layout tables keep their grid; grid lines may hang past the
  page foot (8d854de9)
- Cell-ruled tables: unstated sides unruled (35cdc651)
- Picture lines in cells keep to the grid (dee02ae9)
- `leftChars` counts from the hanging line (e4a5cf77)
- Lone page-break mark holds its page before mode 15 (444b6614)
- Page numbers per section (aaeca4fd)
- `w:topLinePunct` at a paragraph's start (b4f5393e)
- Embedded faces are not swapped for YaHei (d5c74cec)
- Declared-Latin unknown faces set in Calibri (55b60b0e)
- Space after stays at the page foot (a0237668)
- Outside/inside alignment by page side (607bfce9)
- Justified mode-15 spaces give a quarter each (fe308378)
- Font-table `w:altName` for faces Word lacks (551ad92d)
- Gridded multi-line paragraphs use the tallest strut (02e1c405)
- Fit-to-text text boxes shrink to their text (92c1b88a)

## Open tasks

Ranked roughly by lines at stake. "Known" is what has been measured;
start from there.

### T1. Autofit tables
Owner: —
Documents: zh-0aac9d1a (63%), and likely others among the forms.
Known: `w:tblLayout autofit`, grid 1350/3022/1526/2680 twips; Word draws
the columns 34.5/187.7/110.4/156.5pt, wider than `tblW` and the text
column. Word's autofit algorithm (content minimum and maximum widths)
needs labs; nothing built.

### T2. Per-section column layouts
Owner: —
Documents: zh-a0e932c2 (23%, 7 pages to Word's 5).
Known: a section of three unequal columns filled by column breaks,
then a one-column continuous section on the same page. The layout has
one column count for the whole document (`pageSetup.columns`, slots of
`page * columns`). A larger change to pagination.

### T3. `w:mirrorIndents`
Owner: —
Documents: zh-06c46ba9 (0.7%, 687 paragraphs), one more in the sample.
Known (`office.md`): on odd pages the left and right indents swap, with
the first line's indent moving to the right. The indent depends on the
page the paragraph lands on, so the layout must run again after paging.

### T4. Heading spacing at a page's top — DONE (2026-10-14)
Owner: session 011uWpmCQYr9neyJ1V1gzrrb
Space kept at a page's top is less the previous paragraph's space after
(entry in `office.md`). zh-64044a1d 27 -> 33, zh-6d1afa56 16 -> 36.
zh-64044a1d still runs 119 pages to Word's 103: the next difference is
open for anyone.

### T5. zh-6d1afa56: headings led by breaks
Owner: session 011ZXp8eXomzYegGkuu7484P (Windows box, Word for Windows only), from 2026-10-14
Documents: zh-6d1afa56 (16%), zh-1a3c7aa0 (24%).
Known: break-led headings came out at three different heights — likely
the T4 rule (re-check after it); in
zh-1a3c7aa0 the second (landscape) section starts pages earlier than in
Word, and the odd-page footer stands 8pt lower than Word's.

### T6. Body pictures on the line grid
Owner: —
Documents: zh-e5709b89 (+5.7 when body pictures were snapped),
zh-90e0cea8 (−1 page when they were).
Known: in table cells Word snaps a picture's line to whole pitches,
extra above. In the body it does for some documents and not others; the
difference is not found.

### T7. zh-abe7e063, zh-25c4de17, zh-799c91cd, zh-190d730c
Owner: —
Not looked at this round. zh-190d730c's first difference is a scorer
artefact (a justified line drawn out of order); zh-25c4de17 is a
two-column exam where a line changes column on page 2.

### T8. Load embedded fonts
Owner: —
Documents: zh-e37f8d40 (already 92.8% with the square model),
saut_page.
Known: `word/fonts/*.odttf`, obfuscated with the `w:fontKey` GUID
(XOR of the first 32 bytes). Not loaded; the name only keeps the square
face model.

### T9. Nested tables with hidden text
Owner: —
Documents: zh-454e2e29 (49%), row 2.
